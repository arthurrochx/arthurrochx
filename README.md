Hello, my name is Lucas, or you can call me Munhoz which is my surname.

Passionate about web development, programming, softwares, how software works, how it is made and also passionate about games. In 2020 I decided
to study the C language, at the time I already understood how technologies used to work, but I was still wondering myself what I would do for living, it was at that time
I learned how softwares were made. I decide to specialize in web development at the end of 2021, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and following the banck-end specialization
path using Express, TypeScript and NodeJS.
